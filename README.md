# KanjiClip
Paste images with Japanese text to extract AI powered OCR translations and quickly add them to your Anki deck.

## Features
- **AI-Powered OCR**: Utilizes ChatGPT 4o to accurately extract text from images. As far as I tested, it is pretty reliable.
- **Quick Anki Integration**: Seamlessly add extracted text as flashcards to your Anki decks using AnkiConnect.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy navigation and usage.
